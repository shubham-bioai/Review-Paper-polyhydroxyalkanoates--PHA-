## Core Research Questions

1. What are the primary cost and scalability barriers in microbial PHA production?
2. Why have conventional production strategies failed at commercial scale?
3. How can genetic and metabolic engineering improve yield and reduce cost?
4. What role can synthetic biology play in future PHA optimization?
5. Can waste-based substrates realistically enhance economic feasibility?

## Review Contribution
This review aims to provide a problem solution roadmap for future PHA research and commercialization, rather than a descriptive summary of existing literature.
